# WorldClock-React
I have add users in firebase so you can access that users. Once the user loggedIn the user dashboard will display which contain clocks. You can only go back to the login or signup form page once the users logout otherwise react app always shows dashboard page if the user doesnt loggedOut.
This is one dummy user name and password you can check with that emailaddress: anshul@gmail.com password: 123456
